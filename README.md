A quick stab at some prompts for a GPT programming coach

This uses an action-plan approach. We prompt ChatGPT to provide lists of sub-subjects / actions, breaking down the larger goals into session-sized bits. At two levels deep we prompt ChatGPT to perform a role and start coaching us on the subject we are at. This last prompt can be repeated for all sub-subjects

# prompt 1
Write an upskill plan for AI coding aimed at a person with learning disabilities and just basic knowledge of html. 
Provide the steps that would lead to a higher level of knowledge about coding and usage of AI.

-- Take the list and insert first subject into the new prompt --

# prompt 2

-- Take the list and insert the first subject into the next prompt --
